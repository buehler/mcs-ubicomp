This is the public repo for the MCS UbiComp Course. The code provided here is intented as a starting point for each assignment.

## Assignment 1: Onboard vs Offboard Data Analytics

In this assignment, students use a Puck.js device and a pre-trained ML model to classify device movements as one of three gestures.


## Assignment 2: Gaze-based Augmented Reality and Decentralized Data Handling

In this assignment, students gain experience working with gaze-based AR.
Concretely, students build a system that can learn how to estimate activities 
from eye tracking data and, following the activity recognition, can provide 
contextual suggestions on an AR display.
Additionally, students interact with a Solid server, 
create their own Pod, share resources (data) with others, 
and adapte the AR application to use such resources.
